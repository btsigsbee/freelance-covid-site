parents, but this is not a requirement for taking part. If only one of you wishes to
participate that’s OK.
It does not matter whether you are still currently at home due to COVID-19 or have returned to
work but were previously working at home due to it. If you are unsure whether you are eligible to participate, click on this link to complete our 2-
