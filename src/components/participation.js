<h4 className='font-signika heading-col'>What to expect during the interview</h4><text className='font-mont'>During the interview, we will ask you a series of open-ended questions. There are no right or
wrong answers; we are just interested in hearing your thoughts, feelings, and experiences
regarding COVID-19 and how you have managed to balance work and parenting demands. The
interviews are variable in length, but typically lasts about an hour. Most people find the
interview enjoyable and interesting, and they appreciate the opportunity to reflect on their
experiences. You do not have to answer any question you don’t want to and can stop the interview at
any time. All information you share with us will be kept strictly confidential. This means it won’t
be shared with anyone beyond the research team – including your partner if they also decide to
participate.</text></Col></Row>
